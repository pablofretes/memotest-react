# memotest-react

## Description
  
    This is a FullStack memotest game app made to play memotest and make a leaderboard of the best scores.
    The Backend was made using Apollo GraphQL.
    The Frontend was made using React.
    My motivation for this project comes from one of the learning projects at https://argentinaprograma.com/ .
    The idea was to just make a memotest but I decided to expand on it a little.
